# MovieDataAnalysis
Analysis for a movie dataset. This was part of a project for the course [MYE012 Data Mining](http://www.cse.uoi.gr/~tsap/teaching/cse012/index-en.html). The task was to analyze a given dataset comprised of ~3000 movies. The data had missing info on some movies, so it had to be cleaned before any assumptions could be made. The analysis is presented as a Jupyter Notebook. It uses pandas, seaborn, numpy and scipy. To run, install Jupyter Notebook through anaconda.
